# Discord-ID-Lookup

## Language
Ruby

## Auto-Closing?
Fix 1: 
If the application is auto closing you will need to make sure you have ruby installed. https://rubyinstaller.org/
Just follow the steps. Once you finish the steps, a cmd will popup, wait until it's done installing everything and press enter, it will start again, wait until it's done and then press enter again. The installer should close and then you will be able to run the application. 

Fix 2:
You can run any ruby file in normal cmd. However, it is recommended that you run it while showing error logs just in case something does break in normal cmd. To run it in cmd do the following: 
1. open cmd
2. Make sure you cd to the location the file is at. (Ex: if it's on your Desktop, simply enter: "cd Desktop" and it'll direct you there)
3. enter: ruby FileName.rb 2> errors.log
4. There you go, the program should now be running. Just enter the discord ID and you are all set. 

## Notice
This is a very simple method of obtaining data about a discord user using their discord ID! You may improve on this code but give credit if you choose to do so... don't just steal code. If you need help with anything feel free to contact me.
